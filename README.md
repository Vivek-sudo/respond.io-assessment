- controllers: Contains the route handlers that define the API endpoints and handle user requests.
- middlewares: Contains custom middleware functions used in the application, including authentication and error handling middleware.
- models: Defines the database schema and data models using Sequelize ORM for MySQL.
- services: Houses the business logic and data access logic (DAOs) to interact with the database.
- utils: Contains utility modules, including a singleton logger module for logging.
- config: Contains configuration files for different environments (development, production) and environment variables.

2. API Routes
The application provides the following API routes for managing notes:

POST /auth/register: Register a new user with email and password.
POST /auth/login: Authenticate a user and obtain an access token for subsequent API calls.
GET /notes: Get all notes for the authenticated user.
GET /notes/:id: Get a specific note by its ID.
POST /notes: Create a new note.
PUT /notes/:id: Update an existing note.
DELETE /notes/:id: Delete a note by its ID.

3. Authentication
Authentication is performed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they receive an access token, which they must include in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected routes.

4. Error Handling
The application employs a custom error handling middleware to centralize the error handling process. It catches errors thrown in the application and returns standardized error responses to the client.

5. Data Access
The application uses Sequelize ORM to interact with the MySQL database. A DAO Factory pattern is implemented to create data access objects (DAOs) based on the database dialect (MySQL or MongoDB).

6. Redis Caching
Redis is used as a caching layer to improve the application's performance. The application caches certain data, such as user sessions, to reduce database queries.

7. Singleton Logger
A singleton pattern is used to create a shared logger instance across the application. The Winston library is used for logging, and the logger instance is accessible from any module.

8. Dockerization
The application can be easily containerized using Docker. A Dockerfile is provided to build the application image, and a Docker Compose file is used to set up the application stack with MySQL and Redis containers.

9. Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration. A .env file is used to store environment-specific configuration, and Docker Compose passes these environment variables to the application container.

10. Running the Application
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Set up the database and Redis server (or use Docker Compose as described in the README).
Create a .env file and set the required environment variables.
Start the application using npm start.
